# hackathing1
This project was done using a tutorial on 2D game development from Expo. 
https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/tutorials/create-floatyplane-game is the tutorial, and 
https://snack.expo.io/@community/flappy-bird-starter is the base code provided.


The goal of my hack-a-thing was to familiarize myseslf with native-react. I have never coded in JavaScript before, or done any mobile development so this was entirely new to me. Particularly I was interested in the design aspect of making a game (in this case flappy bird as per the tutorial), because I expect to have to do some JavaScript front-end development and design at some point in my life.
I used Expo as a way to host and debug the project Docs here: https://docs.expo.io/versions/v32.0.0/

The code that I wrote/changed is contained within Game.js, which is where all the functions that spawn and manipulate nodes are. I had (and potentially still have) a lot of issues getting the pipes to spawn correctly, but every other aspect of the project runs smoothly.
